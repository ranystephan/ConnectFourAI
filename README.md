## Background

Connect Four is a two-player board game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The goal is to be the first player to get four of your colored discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

This project aims to create a computer player for Connect Four using artificial intelligence techniques. The computer player will be able to play against a human opponent or against another computer player.

## Features

- Single-player mode: play against the computer
- Two-player mode: play against a friend
- Adjustable difficulty level for the computer player
